domain and DNS : 
register from cloudflare # for my case, mycodeforever, oskarcode, 9.15 USD/year
configure name
whois oskarcode.com 



domain regiatory, dns provider 
- get a domain from domain regiatory and configure name server, for cloudflare since i have registered my domains from them, i can configure DNS with IP

check IP and domain:
nslookup 
whois domain


checklists:
- buy domain 
-configure DNS: if your domain and DNS is not from the same registour, you need to have nameservers to add to DNS
- configure reverse DNS: not sure if necessary, if the IP is from aws, need to do with elastic IP 
-change the settings.py allowed hosts, add the domain # after change, reload the supervisor, otherwise the change is not synced
-change the django.config in nginx, added new domains
