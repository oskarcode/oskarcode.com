project:
I created a my blog and make it live with the tutorial here, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa_kQheCnds&list=PL-osiE80TeTtoQCKZ03TU5fNfx2UY6U4p&index=13
I did change some parts and deplot it with different way. 


Check lists:
- Python, Jango, venv 
- django-admin # to get all commands with django such as runserver
django-admin startproject projectname # create a project 
- with the same directory as manage.py, run: python manage.py startapp blog # will create an application under the project called blog

Project directory
settings.py
- update installed application, every time when we created new apps, need to add the class name from apps.py
urls.py
- define the path, function and name


App directory
urls.py
- redirect from project urls.py
views.py
-main function/logic for the apps
templates/appname 
-template for the views
base.html
- can reused for other templates, can be defined  with:  {% block content %}{% endblock%}, the block area can be overwrite, other area kept same with sub template /
to extend the base.html, put {% extends 'base.html %}
static/appname
-need to create this folder for static files such as main.css. To include main.css file put {% load static %} on the top of the files, in href='{% static 'static/main.css %}'/
what this does here is generate a path and access



Synyx
- {{}} : access variable, a bit like dictionary, e.g., {{post.title}}, this will get title of the post 
- {% %} : put function in it, e.g., {% for i in n% }{% endfor }, this will run for loop
-{ % static 'path' %}: access the static path, e.g., href = '{ % static 'path' %}'
- {% url 'path '%} : access the url path, e.g, href = '{ % url 'path' %}', instead of hardcoding url path, we used url function and name of the path to get the url
- makemigrations/migrate: anytime update DB, needs to run this to update, when migarted, it creates a DB table backend for us
-python manage.py shell: we can play with models or db with SQL language


Security best practises:
- use variables for sensitive info such as secret keys, email credential
